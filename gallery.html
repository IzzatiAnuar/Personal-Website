<p>This was my favourite netball team during my diploma. Even I'm not that kind of person who always active in sport, but they encouraged me to stay motivated until the end of the game. Although we did not win, but we have created a memory that I will never forget.</p>

<p>At the weekend, I will be participating in volunteer activities. This is one of the activities that I have participated in. My team and I handled a program where the purpose of the program was to make a contribution to the needed kids.</p>

<p>Throughout my diploma and degree, I have also run several programs while at uitm puncak alam and uitm kota bharu. This is one of biggest programs (U-Day Festival) my group and I have ever run. U-Day Festival involves UiTM students as well as outsiders.</p>

<p>Despite all that, I am very grateful to be able to divide my time and focus on my studies. Alhamdulillah, I was able to maintain a pointer 3.5 and above throughout my diploma and degree.</p>
