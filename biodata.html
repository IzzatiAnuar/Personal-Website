Islamic Banking. I'm the oldest among three sisters so I know ladies well, hehe!. I love to involve in association, therefore I tried luck for an interview and now hold a position in my current university as treasurer in City Campus Representative Jawatankuasa Perwakilan Non-resident and had undergoing some programs during my studies since I was in diploma. Currently I work as part-time freelancer and had created logos, brouchers, letterhead and many more.Since I have passionate in handling program and involve in management, I plan to seek for a job that relate to the management and have more interaction with people. I believe that I can work well in team. If one day, I receive a responsibilty to handle a team as a leader, I will try my best to handle my team.
